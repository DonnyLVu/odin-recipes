    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A classic pizza typically consists of a homemade or store-bought dough
      base, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and various toppings
      such as pepperoni, mushrooms, and bell peppers. It is often baked in a
      wood-fired or gas oven until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted.
      Some variations may also include additional ingredients such as olives,
      anchovies, or even pineapple. A classic pizza can be served either in
      slices or as a whole pie, and is often considered a staple dish in Italian
      cuisine.
